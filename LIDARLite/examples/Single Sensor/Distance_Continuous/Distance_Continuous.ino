//  # LIDAR-Lite v2: Continous distance measruments
//
//  This example file will demonstrate how to tell the sensor to take a continous set of readings by
//  writing the speed and number of measruments directly to the sensor, freeing the micro-controller
//  to read when it is ready.
//
//  The library is in BETA, so subscribe to the github repo to recieve updates, or just check in periodically
//  https://github.com/PulsedLight3D/LIDARLite_v2_Arduino_Library
//  To learn more read over lidarlite.cpp as each function is commented
